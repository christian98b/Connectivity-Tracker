This project is a c# WPF .net 8 project.

Its a connectivtiy tracker for windows that checks how well the internet connection is.

Your workflow is as follows. You use the todo.md file and the userstories.mdd file.

If the todo file (with todos with checkboxes)= is empty, use the userstories.md file to transform the userstories into todos you need to do, in order to achieve the project goal.

Then if the todo.md is existing. Program the todos in order and check them off as you go.
